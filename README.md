# ImmersiveRealms
An encrypted realm ever expanding within itself.
An immersive reality of ones actuality. Compartmentalized human experiences experienced by other humans who will pair up in private and encrypted settings that link one or more people to another person's reality which is defined by their perspective. There are many questions that will be answered by this technology. The most elite of knowledgeable people will come to an understanding of how others perceive the world around them. How people of other gene pools tend to view things of life and its algorithm. By routing via AI to create an algorithm that can do exactly what you are asking because it has already done it in a digital and virtual sense.

There will be a version of Artificial Intelligence that will map out the vail  of living organisms and otherwise. It will know the marbling of organic tissue. It will map out the cosmos and categorize the elements and where they come from in the cosmos through a system called algorithmatic or algorithmic rooting. An ever expanding universe as of our own will be rendered in such a defined way that it will mirror our universe within our universe and that universe will do it again and again virtually forever. Each version will be slightly askew from the last version. Time slows as our cells are multiplied within our own Realms.
